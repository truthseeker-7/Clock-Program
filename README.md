# Clock Program
This is a simple analog clock program that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# How to Use
Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to view the clock program. The program will automatically display the current time, updating every second.

# Code Overview
The clock program consists of an HTML file index.html, a CSS file style.css, and a JavaScript file script.js.

The HTML file contains the basic structure of the clock program, including a container with 12 number markers, and three clock hands (hour, minute, and second).

The CSS file styles the clock program, including the position and size of the clock hands, and the font and color of the number markers.

The JavaScript file contains the logic for the clock program. It retrieves the current time using the Date() object, and rotates the clock hands accordingly using CSS transforms. The rotate() function updates the rotation angle of each clock hand every second, minute, and hour using the setInterval() method.
